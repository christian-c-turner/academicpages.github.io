title: "MSc Thesis | Ideological Polarization in Urban Social Networks: A Study of Facebook Event Attendance in Copenhagen (2013â€“2017)"
excerpt: "This thesis investigates ideological polarization and homophily in urban social life by analyzing
Facebook event co-attendance in Copenhagen from 2013 to 2017. Drawing on a dataset of over
100,000 events and 1 million users, I construct bipartite networks of events and attendees, then
project these into event-event and user-user networks. Ideological alignment and demographic
traits were previously inferred for politically active users, allowing for the measurement of
polarization and social homophily over time and across demographic groups. Using a generalized
Euclidean distance measure, I quantify ideological polarization in event networks by event size,
revealing increased polarization in the small-events network following the 2015 Danish national
election. In user networks, I compare ego-networks to proportional mixing baselines to assess
demographic and ideological homophily, focusing on interactions involving ideologically right-
leaning users. Results show evidence of ideological homophily, suggesting that even in high-
trust, cooperative urban settings like Copenhagen, social life may reflect subtle but meaningful
ideological divides. <br/><img src='/images/small_event_2013-2014_Ideo_crop.png'>"
